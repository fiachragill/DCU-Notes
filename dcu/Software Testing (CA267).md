# ISTQB

- #### ISTQB is the global standard for certification of software testers.

- #### ISTQB is responsible for the international qualification scheme called "ISTQB Certified Tester"

# Failures, Defects and Erorrs 

> “A failure is present if a warrantable (user) expectation is not fulfilled adequately”

- #### A Failure is **a deviation of the software from its expected delivery or service.**

- #### A Defect is  a manifestation of human error in software.

- #### An Error is a human action producing an incorrect result, they are ineveitable in a complex activity.

# Testing

- #### Testing is the systematic exploration of a component/system with the main aim of finding and reporting defects.

## Objectives:
- ##### Finding defects
- ##### Gaining confidence on quality level
- ##### Provide information on defects
- ##### Prevent future defects from occurring

## Types of Testing
- ##### Regression/Maintenance Testing
- ##### Operational Testing

## Types of Dynamic Testing
- ##### Integration Testing
- ##### Unit Testing
- ##### System Testing

- ### Static Testing is testing without executing the program.
- ### Dynamic Testing is testing by executing the program with real inputs.
