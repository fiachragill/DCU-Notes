# ISTQB

- #### ISTQB is the global standard for certification of software testers.

- #### ISTQB is responsible for the international qualification scheme called "ISTQB Certified Tester"

# Failures, Defects and Erorrs 

> “A failure is present if a warrantable (user) expectation is not fulfilled adequately”

- #### A Failure is **a deviation of the software from its expected delivery or service.**

- #### A Defect is  a manifestation of human error in software.

- #### An Error is a human action producing an incorrect result, they are ineveitable in a complex activity.

# Testing

 >"Testing is the systematic exploration of a component/system with the main aim of finding and reporting defects"

## Objectives:

- Finding defects
- Gaining confidence on quality level
-  Provide information on defects
- Prevent future defects from occurring

## Who does the testing?

- Programmers
- Users (With support)
- Independent teams/ organistations (Formally)

## Test team roles

- ### Test manager
	Plan, organise, manage and controls the testing.
- ### Tester
	prep test procedures, data enviroments & expected results.
	execute tests and log incidents.
	execute re-tests and regression tests.
- ### Test Analyst
	scope the testing, conduct expert interviews
	document test specs
	prepare test reports 
- ### Test automation technician
	record code and test automated scripts
	prep test data + expected results
	execute automated scripts

## Expected Results

> "Specifications, requirements ect. define what the soft ware is required to do"

### Testers need them to :
- identify the things that need testing
- compare test results with requirments

> "A baseline document describes how we require the system to behave"

## Failure to define expected results...
- can result in erroneous results being interperated as correct.
- there may be a subconscious desire to see the software pass the test.

### *Expected results must be defined before test execution, derived from a baseline*

## Exit, Completion, Closure or Acceptance criteria

### Trigger to say:

> "we've done enough"

### Hitting some measurable/achievable target for example:

	- 80% coverage achieved
	- all tests executed without failure
	- all outstanding incidents waived
	- all critical business scenarios covered

# Fundamental Test Process

## What is a test?

### A test is a controlled exercise involving:

	  an object under test
	  a definition of the enviroment
	  a definition of the inputs
	  a definition of the outputs or results

### When a test is preformed you get...

	an actual output or result
	a determination whether the result is correct.	

- When a test is ran we must have an expected result derived from the baseline.
- An actual result either matches or does not the expected
- Difference == fault,  therefore investigation is in order.

## Test analysis

> "Test analysis is the activity where tangible test conditions and test designs are derived from the baseline documents"
